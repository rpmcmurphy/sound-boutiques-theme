One thing could you clarify? I tried and downloaded a song without paying. From the source code. So, they are playing the song in a low quality version and will let me download a high-quality one if I purchase?

Aug 26, 3:42 AM
Yes. I can build a theme like this for you. Also, there are existing themes available which are for selling audios like yours. I could customize one you like and make it look nice and clean. Like Spotify. Depending on your budget. Both can be done.

what is the price different ?

n
Me
Aug 26, 3:45 AM
Well, that would be quite much. One for customizing existing themes and one for making one from scratch. Customizing and setting up one will cost $500+- and making one from scratch will cost $1000+.
But you will get all the independence to pick the colors and designs and everything you like.

n
Me
Aug 26, 3:46 AM
Depends on the theme also. If you pick one which will need less customization, then lesser cost actually.

n
Me
Aug 26, 3:47 AM
But for building one from scratch, it's like handmade jewelry.

I am ok with that. Fiverr has this system called milestones. You can set two targets for the project, one in the beginning. And one in the middle. Fiverr won't allow paying in the end.

So we can set $550 in the beginning milestone and set the second milestone when around 75% of the project is done. We good with that?

It's Fiverr system. System won't allow us to transfer payment while project is complete.

No no. It's a fiverr thing, not related to theme or project.

Fiverr let's you divide the project into milestones. Since you are ready to pay $550 now, the project will be divide into two milestones. Initially fiverr won't ask you to pay full. That's what they call milestone.
